```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mauriceLC92/screenshot-sweeper.git
cd screenshot-sweeper

# Build the project
swift build

# Run the app
swift run
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build for release
swift build --configuration release

# Run tests
swift test
swift test --parallel                    # Run tests in parallel
swift test --filter NextRunCalculatorTests  # Run specific test class

# Package management
swift package resolve                    # Resolve dependencies

### Project Architecture

Screenshot Sweeper follows an MVVM architecture with a clean separation of concerns:

- **Models**: `Settings` - Codable configuration with UserDefaults persistence
- **Services**: Core business logic (`CleanupService`, `FolderAccess`, `Scheduler`)
- **ViewModels**: `AppViewModel` - Central state management with `@Published` properties
- **Views**: SwiftUI components for menu bar and preferences interfaces
- **Utilities**: Helper functions like `NextRunCalculator` for scheduling logic

Key architectural patterns:
- Security-scoped bookmarks for sandboxed file access
- Custom `PreferencesWindowController` for window management
- Dynamic activation policy switching (`.accessory` ‚Üî `.regular`)
- Extensive logging and permission error handling

### Common Review Issues and Solutions

#### Potential Rejection Reasons
- **Sandbox Violations**: Ensure all file access uses proper entitlements
- **UI Guidelines**: Menu bar apps should follow macOS design principles
- **Permission Handling**: Must gracefully handle denied permissions
- **Metadata Issues**: Screenshots and descriptions must accurately represent functionality

#### Best Practices
- Test thoroughly on clean macOS installations
- Verify all user-facing text is properly localized
- Ensure app works without internet connectivity
- Handle all error states gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Test permission flows extensively

### Post-Launch Maintenance

#### Version Updates
- Increment version numbers for each update
- Provide clear release notes
- Test updates don't break existing user configurations
- Monitor crash reports and user feedback

#### Ongoing Compliance
- Keep up with Apple's changing requirements
- Update certificates before expiration
- Respond to security vulnerability reports
- Maintain privacy policy accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Files Not Being Moved
1. **Check Permissions**: 
   - System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Files and Folders
   - Ensure Desktop access is enabled for Screenshot Sweeper

2. **Folder Access Issues**:
   - If using custom folder destination, reselect the folder in Preferences
   - Check that destination folder still exists and is accessible

3. **Screenshot Prefix Mismatch**:
   - Verify the prefix setting matches your actual screenshot files
   - Check case sensitivity setting

#### App Not Running Automatically
- Verify cleanup schedule is enabled in Preferences
- Check that cleanup time is set to desired hour
- App must remain running in menu bar for scheduled cleanup

#### High CPU Usage
- Check for large numbers of files on Desktop
- Consider filtering by more specific prefix
- Monitor Activity Monitor for unusual behavior

### Permission Errors

If you see permission-related errors:
1. Quit Screenshot Sweeper completely
2. Remove and re-add file access permissions in System Settings
3. Restart Screenshot Sweeper
4. Reselect destination folder if using custom folder option
