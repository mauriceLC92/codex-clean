# Screenshot Sweeper

Screenshot Sweeper moves Desktop screenshots to the Trash or a folder each day.

## Permissions
The app needs permission to access your Desktop. If files are not being moved,
open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Files and Folders** and allow
*Screenshot Sweeper* to access the Desktop and any destination folder.

## Changing prefix and destination
Use **Preferences…** from the menu bar to change the screenshot prefix, toggle
case sensitivity, pick a destination (Trash or a folder), and adjust the cleanup
time. Folder selections are stored as security‑scoped bookmarks; if access
becomes invalid, the app will ask you to choose the folder again.
